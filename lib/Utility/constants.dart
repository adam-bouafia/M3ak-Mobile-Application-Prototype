    """ “There is no government, there is no state, we are the state”. These chilling words by a police officer, during a sit-in in the city of Sfax on 2 February, speak volumes about the dangerous turn of events in Tunisia in recent weeks. The latest unrest heightens risks of a return to a police state following years of shaky democratic transition which has failed to end abuses by security services and their rampant impunity for human rights violations.

“It is time to go back to school. On a bright sunny autumn morning, with a touch of frost, after parking the cars, tunisian parents are holding their children's hands heading to their classes. They are afraid of leaving them. After tunisian coup, and amid the insecurity situation, violence and robbery have become habitual actions in tunisian streets where children are among the victims of these crimes”.

“When it comes to the support system in place, and especially as far as Law 58 is concerned, our learning journey highlighted that much more needs to be done in terms of training, standardization of procedures and vulgarization as well as disseminating information on how the law is operationalized. User experience design can be a good place to start imagining more empathic and people centered services, which are close and easy of access.”

“In addition to the usual causes of crime such as unemployment, marginalisation and poverty, the changing consumption patterns of society have had a great influence on the growth of violence in Tunisia.”  """,
