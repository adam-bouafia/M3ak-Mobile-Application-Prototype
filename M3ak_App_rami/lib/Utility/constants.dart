These chilling words by a police officer, during a sit-in in the city of Sfax on 2 February, speak volumes about the dangerous turn of events in Tunisia in recent weeks. The latest unrest heightens risks of a return to a police state following years of shaky democratic transition which has failed to end abuses by security services and their rampant impunity for human rights violations.

“It is time to go back to school. On a bright sunny autumn morning, with a touch of frost, after parking the cars, tunisian parents are holding their children's hands heading to their classes.
