The application's "Safe Shake" mode allows you to alert your loved ones by simply shaking your phone. ðŸ“³
An alert SMS will be sent to the individuals you have selected, ensuring that help is just a shake away. You can activate this mode when entering risky locations or whenever you feel threatened.
I am immensely proud to have contributed to this important initiative, leveraging technology to promote safety, empowerment, and the fight against gender-based violence. ðŸ™Œ
Join me in downloading the "Dhayen" app and supporting the cause of a violence-free society for women and girls.
